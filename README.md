# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is ***Frank*** and I'm a ***Computer Science*** student 

I am a Computer Science student near graduate in Hungary. 

I'm mostly experienced in front-end development especially in React TypeScript.
There are several tools what I've used with React for example Redux, MobX, Axios, JWT.
I am more practical in creating front-end using existing API and design but I want to be a fullstack developer. I've used to create backend with NodeJs, Java (with Spring) and ASP.Net. 

Professional development it's very important to me, so I use to do different courses find on the internet (mostly Youtube and Udemy), learning documentations forums, blogs and books.

I am very interestend in design patterns, principles and clean code.
I love and recommend several books in this themes:
- Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin
- The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers by Robert C. Martin
- Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design by Robert C. Martin
- Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides
- Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide by Eric Freeman
